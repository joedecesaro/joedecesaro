### Hi there 👋

My name is Joe and I am an aspiring data scientist. I am a recent graduate of the Bren School with a masters in Environmental Data Science. We had a variety of classes in our program including remote sensing, spatial analysis, statistics, machine learning, data visualization and more.

Our biggest project was our capstone projects. My team's project focuses renewable energy siting using statistics and machine learning. We took multiple geospatial datasets to determine the most important factors for siting utility scale renewable energy projects. Using this we will then made a projection map of the most likely areas for utility scale renewable energy to be approved in the future. You can view a summary of this project at: https://energysiting.github.io/energysiting-dashboard/#overview

I have previously worked as an envrionmental engineer in California and have extenssive consulting and compliance experience. I have also worked in a variety of manufacturing settings. Having completed my master's program I am hoping to continue work in the renewable engery field.
