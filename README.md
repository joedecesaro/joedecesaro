### Hi there 👋

My name is Joe and I am an aspiring data scientist. I am a recent graduate of the Bren School with a masters in Environmental Data Science. We had a variety of classes in our program including remote sensing, spatial analysis, statistics, machine learning, data visualization and more.

Our biggest project was our capstone projects. My team's project focuses renewable energy siting using statistics and machine learning. We took multiple geospatial datasets to determine the most important factors for siting utility scale renewable energy projects. Using this we will then made a projection map of the most likely areas for utility scale renewable energy to be approved in the future. You can view a summary of this project at: https://energysiting.github.io/energysiting-dashboard/#overview

Currently I am working as a data analyst for the National Center for ECological Anlaysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). In this role I am using the skills from my master's program into various research efforts. Some of this work is understanding the environmental justice implications of the environmental effects of food systems and mapping aquaculture potential across the contiguous US.
