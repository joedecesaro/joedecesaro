### Hi, Iâ€™m Joe ðŸ‘‹

I work on large-scale geospatial analysis at NCEAS, where I help build the Wildfire Resilience Index. Most days Iâ€™m wrangling rasters and time series data in R and Python, turning raw indicators like NDVI, precipitation, land cover, and tree traits into clear, reusable layers and maps. I care a lot about reproducibility and making results easy for others to use so things like consistent CRS/resolution, sensible nodata handling, and little utilities that save teammates time.

Before this, I finished an M.S. in Environmental Data Science at the UCSB Bren School. Iâ€™ve also led and contributed to research on how dietary shifts and marine aquaculture affect environmental pressures. 

**Tools I reach for:** R/terra/sf, GDAL, Python/rasterio/pandas, Quarto, Git/GitHub.
