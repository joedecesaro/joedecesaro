### Hi there 👋

My name is Joe and I am an aspiring data scientist. I’m currently a student at the Bren School getting a masters in Environmental Data Science. We have taken classes in remote sensing, spatial analysis, statistics, machine learning, and more. My capstone project focuses renewable energy siting using statistics and machine learning. We are taking multiple geospatial datasets to determine the most important factors for utility scale renewable energy projects to be operational. Using this we will then make a prediction map of the most likely areas for utility scale renewable energy to be approved in the future.

I have previously worked as an envrionmental engineer in California and have extenssive consulting and compliance experience. I have also worked in a variety of manufacturing settings. After completing my master's program I am hoping to work in the renewable engery field.
