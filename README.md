### Hi there 👋

My name is Joe and I am a Data Analyst at the National Center For Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). I am currently working on a spatial analysis of marine aquaculture and analyzing some global effects if the world changes its' diet. Prior to my current role I graduated from the Bren School with a masters in Environmental Data Science. 

An example of my work from the masters program is the capstone projects. My team's project focuses renewable energy siting using statistics and machine learning. We took multiple geospatial datasets to determine the most important factors for siting utility scale renewable energy projects. Using this we will then made a projection map of the most likely areas for utility scale renewable energy to be approved in the future. You can view a summary of this project at: https://energysiting.github.io/energysiting-dashboard/#overview
